      MultiplayerSet is a game about pattern matching. The idea is to find
      <b>sets</b> of three cards that meet certain requirements. Each card has a
      four properties. The properties are <b>amount</b> (of shapes),
      <b>shape</b>, <b>color</b>, and <b>shading</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
      A <b>set</b> is three cards for which each card has, for each property, three
      different properties or one uniform property. Two cards that are both red
      and a third that is green are <b>not</b> a set.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li><h2>Examples of VALID sets</h2></li>
      <li class="message cornered">
      <div class="clear"></div>
      <div class="set">
        <div class="cardwrap" number="0" color="0" shape="0" shading="0"></div>
        <div class="cardwrap" number="0" color="1" shape="0" shading="1"></div>
        <div class="cardwrap" number="0" color="2" shape="0" shading="2"></div>
      </div>
      <p>
      Here all the cards have the same <b>shape</b> (oval) and <b>amount</b>
      (one) but different <b>shadings</b> and <b>colors</b>.
      </p>
      <div class="clear"></div>
      <div class="set">
        <div class="cardwrap" number="2" color="2" shape="0" shading="0"></div>
        <div class="cardwrap" number="1" color="0" shape="1" shading="1"></div>
        <div class="cardwrap" number="0" color="1" shape="2" shading="2"></div>
      </div>
      <p>
      In this set, all four attributes are different across all three cards.
      </p>
      <div class="clear"></div>
      </li>
      <li><h2>Examples of INVALID sets</h2></li>
      <li class="message cornered">
      <p>
      As a rule, if a set has two cards that share a property (such as two cards
      that both have ovals), but the third one differs (it has diamonds), then
      it is NOT a set. Here are some examples.
      </p>
      <div class="set">
        <div class="cardwrap" number="0" color="0" shape="0" shading="0"></div>
        <div class="cardwrap" number="0" color="0" shape="0" shading="1"></div>
        <div class="cardwrap" number="0" color="2" shape="0" shading="2"></div>
      </div>
      <p>
      Identical to the first example set except that two of the cards are red,
      and the other green. If one of the red cards were blue or if all three
      cards were red, it would be a set.
      </p>
      <div class="clear"></div>
      <div class="set">
        <div class="cardwrap" number="1" color="0" shape="1" shading="0"></div>
        <div class="cardwrap" number="2" color="2" shape="2" shading="1"></div>
        <div class="cardwrap" number="0" color="1" shape="1" shading="1"></div>
      </div>
      <p>
      This is not a set because there are two diamonds and two hollow-shaded cards.
      If all the cards were diamond and hollow, it would be a set. Alternatively,
      if the last card was a striped squiggly shape, it would also be a set.

      <li><h2>How to play</h2></li>
      <li class="message cornered full">
      <p>
      If you want to play with friends, hit <b>start a private game</b> in the top
      left of this page. You will receive a link you can use to invite other people
      to join.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you want to get into a game quickly, hit <b>join a public game</b>. You will
      be placed into a game that will start as soon as three people are present. You
      can still invite your friends to join a public game in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
      Once in a game, click cards to build sets. Click on any part of the board to
      clear your current selection. Type messages and hit enter to talk to the
      other players in the game.
      </p>
      <h3>Hints</h3>
      <p>
      If you need a hint or don't see a set on the board (which can happen), use
      the <b>HINT</b> button. If the majority of players do this, the
      game will reveal one card of a set on the board. If there are none, the game
      will deal three additional cards.
